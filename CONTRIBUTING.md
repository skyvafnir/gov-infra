# Contributing

## Contribution Model

`gov-infra` aims to be a collaborative effort between public institutions in Iceland, and as such, the following principles apply:

Contributions should:

- Originate from, or be written on behalf of, the public institutions themselves, as they are the primary stakeholders in this project.
- Address real needs and challenges that the institutions face when adopting cloud solutions.
- Align with the principles described in the [Governance Framework for Microsoft Azure in Iceland](https://www.stjornarradid.is/library/02-Rit--skyrslur-og-skrar/Governance%20Framework%20for%20Azure%20in%20GovIceland%20v1.0%20-%20OpenVersion.pdf) (for Azure)
  and the [Strategic Cloud Policies](https://island.is/en/o/digital-iceland/Cloud-Policy-Icelandic-Public-Sector) (in general).
